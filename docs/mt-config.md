# git-apple-llvm: mt-config

mt-config files consists of declarations of:

- `repo`, for remote repositories;
- `repeat`, for repeating commits from another generated branch;
- `dir`, for declaring which remote branches to use for directory content; and
- `generate`, for declaring what to generate.

## `repo`: Declaring a repository

```
repo <name> <url>
```

where `<name>` is the local name for the remote and `<url>` is its URL.

## Defining a branch

Branches are generated by interleaving commits from the associated `<dir>` and
`<repeat>` declarations.

### `repeat`: Interleaving one generated branch's commits into another

```
repeat <branch> <upstream>
```

Every time there is a commit to `<upstream>`, generate a merge commit on
`<branch>` that pulls it in, excluding any changes matching `dir` directives.

This can be useful to generate consistent histories "as if" an automerger had
been pulling in all changes from an upstream branch, when in fact some
repositories had a single branch being used for two purposes.

### `dir`: Generating commits from a split repo

```
dir <branch> ( <name> | '-' ) <source>
```

`dir` declares the repositories to interleave to generate `<branch>`.  The
commits are taken from `<source>`, which is expected to be a commitish (branch,
tag, commit hash, etc.) from one of the `repo` declarations, and interleaved into `<branch>` at the directory named `<name>/`.

`-` can be given instead of `<name>`, which cause `<source>`'s contents to be
"dereferenced" and put at the root.  This is intended for downstream repos of
<https://git.llvm.org/git/monorepo-root.git>.  It's recommended that these
repos only have blobs; all subdirectories should be in a separate split
repository.

## `generate`: What to do, and in what order

```
generate <sort> <type> <object>
```

`generate` declares what to do, critically specifying an order of action.  The
declared actions will be completed in sorted order.  `<sort>` is designed to be
a `0`-padded number.

The currently supported values for `<type>` are:

- `mapping`: generate an svn2git mapping from all the branches in the remote
  named `<object>`.
- `branch`: generate a branch named `<object>`, using the associated
  `repeat`, and `dir` declarations.
- `splitrefs`: create splitrefs ending in `/mt-split` for the given
  pseudo-branch, updating anything that has already been mapped.
    - Like `branch`, looks for `dir` declarations.  `repeat` is not supported.
    - Only useful as a follow-up to the `mapping` command.
    - This optimization reduces work in `branch` directives by calculating and
      efficiently caching the implicitly mapped svn2git commits.
